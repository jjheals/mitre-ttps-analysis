        "description": "[Operation Dream Job](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0022) was a cyber espionage operation likely conducted by [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) that targeted the defense, aerospace, government, and other sectors in the United States, Israel, Australia, Russia, and India. In at least one case, the cyber actors tried to monetize their network access to conduct a business email compromise (BEC) operation. In 2020, security researchers noted overlapping TTPs, to include fake job lures and code similarities, between [Operation Dream Job](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0022), Operation North Star, and Operation Interception; by 2022 security researchers described [Operation Dream Job](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0022) as an umbrella term covering both Operation Interception and Operation North Star.(Citation: ClearSky Lazarus Aug 2020)(Citation: McAfee Lazarus Jul 2020)(Citation: ESET Lazarus Jun 2020)(Citation: The Hacker News Lazarus Aug 2022)",

[APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) used customized malware to inject malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software build process that was later distributed through a normal software update; they also used password spraying, token theft, API abuse, spear phishing, and other supply chain attacks to compromise user accounts and leverage their associated access.
